I've been doing some reviewing of time and space complexity analysis to assess diferrent ways of solving a problem. I decided to look at the age old ways of sorting an array of numbers. For this exercise, I have created a Github repository at [jairrab/KotlinSortingAlgorithmsExercise](https://github.com/jairrab/KotlinSortingAlgorithmsExercise).
